*Diredful.el* provides a simple UI for customizing dired mode to use
different faces and colors. Faces are chosen based on file extension,
file name, or a regexp matching the file line.

Screenshots available at [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/Diredful#toc4][EmacsWiki]].

** Install [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/diredful][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/diredful-badge.svg]] [[https://melpa.org/#/diredful][file:https://melpa.org/packages/diredful-badge.svg]]

Using Melpa:

: M-x package-install RET diredful RET

Then to activate by default, add the following into your init file
(customizing this variable will not work):

: (diredful-mode 1)

or use add-hook

: (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredful-mode)

For manual installation, put diredful.el in your Emacs-Lisp load
path, and add this to your init file:

: (require 'diredful)
: (diredful-mode 1)

** Usage

Do:

: M-x diredful-add

This will ask you to define a new name for a file type, like
"images". You can then specify a list of extensions or file names that
belong to this type and customize the face used to display them. A
new face will be automatically generated and updated for each type.

Note: changes will only be applied to newly created dired
buffers.

File Types can be added, edited, and deleted using the
following commands:

: M-x diredful-add
: M-x diredful-delete
: M-x diredful-edit
: M-x diredful-edit-file-at-point

These settings will be saved to the location of
=diredful-init-file= (the default is
"~/.emacs.d/diredful-conf.el"). You may choose a different location
by doing:

: M-x customize-variable RET diredful-init-file

** Tips

File type names are sorted alphabetically before being applied. If two
file types matched the same file, the file type that comes last in an
alphabetically-sorted list will take precedence (e.g., a type named
"zworldwritable" will take priority over other types).

The world-writable regexp pattern used in the screenshot is =[rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-]w[trwx-]=.
