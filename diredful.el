;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a simple UI for customizing dired mode to use
;; different faces and colors. Faces are chosen based on file
;; extension, file name, or a regexp matching the file line.
;;
;;; Install:
;;
;; Put this file in your Emacs-Lisp load path, and add the following
;; into your $HOME/.emacs startup file.
;;
;;     (require 'diredful)
;;     (diredful-mode 1)
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; Do:
;;
;;     M-x diredful-add
;;
;; This will ask you to define a new name for a file type, such as
;; "images". You can then specify a list of extensions or file names
;; that belong to this type and customize the face used to display
;; them. A new face will be automatically generated and updated for
;; each type.
;;
;; Note: changes will only be applied to newly created dired
;; buffers.
;;
;; File Types can be added, edited, and deleted using the following
;; commands:
;;
;;     M-x diredful-add
;;     M-x diredful-delete
;;     M-x diredful-edit
;;     M-x diredful-edit-file-at-point
;;
;; These settings will be saved to the location of
;; `diredful-init-file' (the default is
;; "~/.emacs.d/diredful-conf.el"). You may choose a different location
;; by doing:
;;
;;     M-x customize-variable <ENTER> diredful-init-file
;;
;; Tip: File type names are sorted alphabetically before being
;; applied. If two file types matched the same file, the file type
;; that comes last in an alphabetically-sorted list will take
;; precedence (e.g., a type named "zworldwritable" will take priority
;; over other types).
